<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript" target="_blank">JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS,</a> is a programming language that is <strong>one of the <u>core technologies</u> of the World Wide Web</strong>, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
</p><p style="margin-top:40px">JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).</p>
